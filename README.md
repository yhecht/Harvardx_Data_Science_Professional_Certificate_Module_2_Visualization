# Harvardx Data Science Professional Certificate


This repository includes my course notes, assessments, and resources from [*Module 2: Visualization*](https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-visualization) of the 17-month-long [Harvardx Professional Certificate Program in Data Science](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science).

## Module 2: Data Science - Visualization

### What I Learned:

#### **Section 1:	Data Visualization, Distributions, Quantiles, Percentiles & Boxplots:** Exploratory Data Analysis
- Understood importance of data visualization for communicating data-driven findings
- Used distributions to summarize data
- Used average & standard deviation to understand normal distribution
- Assessed how well a normal distribution fits data using a quantile-quantile plot
- Interpreted data from a boxplot

#### **Section 2:	ggplot2, Customizing Plots**
- Used ggplot2 to create data visualizations in R
- Explained what data components of a graph is
- Identified geometry components of a graph and knew when to use which type of geometry
- Explained what the aesthetic mapping component of a graph is
- Understand and selected appropriate scale components of a graph

#### **Section 3:	Summarizing with dplyr**
- Understood the importance of summarizing data in exploratory data analysis.
- Used "summarize" verb in dplyr to facilitate summarizing data
- Used "group_by" verb in dplyr to facilitate summarizing data
- Accessed values using the dot placeholder
- Use "arrange" to examine data after sorting

#### **Section 4:	Gapminder**
- Use effective data visualization to convey data-based trends
- Applied ggplot2 techniques from the previous section to answer questions using data
- Understood how fixed scales across plots can ease comparisons
- Modified graphs to improve data visualization

#### **Section 5:	Data Visualization Principles**
- Understood basic principles of effective data visualization
- Understood importance of keeping your goal in mind when deciding on a visualization approach
- Understood principles for encoding data, including position, aligned lengths, angles, area, brightness & color
- Knew when to include the number zero in visualizations
- Used techniques to ease comparisons, such as using common axes, putting visual cues to be compared adjacent to one another & using color effectively
